    						<h4><a href="#">Alpine</a></h4>
    						<p>Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the pastime of sliding down snow-covered slopes on skis with fixed-heel bindings, unlike other types of skiing (cross-country, Telemark, or ski jumping), which use skis with free-heel bindings. Whether for recreation or for sport, it is typically practiced at ski resorts, which provide such services as ski lifts, artificial snow making, snow grooming, restaurants, and ski patrol.</p>

    						<h4><a href="#">Nordic</a></h4>
    						<p>The Nordic disciplines include cross-country skiing and ski jumping, which both use bindings that attach at the toes of the skier's boots but not at the heels. Cross-country skiing may be practiced on groomed trails or in undeveloped backcountry areas. Ski jumping is practiced in certain areas that are reserved exclusively for ski jumping.</p>

    						<p>Telemark skiing is a ski turning technique and FIS-sanctioned discipline, which is named after the Telemark region of Norway. It uses equipment similar to Nordic skiing, where the ski bindings are attached only at the toes of the ski boots, allowing the skier's heel to be raised throughout the turn. However, the skis themselves are often the same width as Alpine skis.</p>

    					<h3>How to Ski</h3>
    					<p class="bold">Tips for your first time</p>
    					<p>Learning to ski can open doors to a lifetime of winter fun and connection to the mountains. Why learn to ski? Skiing offers many benefits. It’s a sport you can enjoy with friends as well as the entire family, young and old. You get access to unmatched mountain terrain. Skiing also gets your heart rate up, burns calories and works your muscles. </p>
    					<p>To make sure you get the most out of your first time, here are a few tips for first-time skiers.</p>

    										<p>To get skiing, you will need the basic gear: skis, boots, and poles. Eric Lipton suggests that you politely decline if a family member or friends offers to lend you some because resorts today are equipped with the best rental equipment. They will also make sure you get the right size and style of gear to ensure the best possible learning experience.</p>
    										<p>The boots are the first thing you’ll try on, they are also the most important piece of equipment. To properly fit your ski boots, start with one pair of thin socks pulled up over your calves. Slide your feet into the boot and press your heel towards the back of the boot. Start by tightening the buckles on the upper cuff to ensure your heels are all the way back and all the way down. The boot should feel snug (but not painful) around your foot and lower leg. If you can slide your foot back and forth inside the boot, chances are the boot is too big. If your toes are squished or curled, you might need a bigger size. Try on a few different sizes to make sure you have the best possible fit.</p>
                        <p>Next up, let’s talk about your skis. The front of the ski is called the tip and the back of the ski is called the tail. Somewhere between the tip and the tail you’ll find the ski binding; bindings are what connects your boot to the ski.When your boot is not pressed into the binding, you’ll notice the ski brake preventing your skis from sliding. Unlike boots, there is no right or left ski, they are interchangeable.</p>

    								<div class="col-xs-12">
    									<div class="single-tab">
    										<p>Before you head to the top of a hill, start with pushing your way around on the flats. Start with your shins pressed against the front of your boots to stay forward and to stay balanced. This will also get you used to the sensation of gliding around on snow.</p>
    										<p>Side-stepping is when you move with your skis perpendicular to the slope (meaning your skis pointed across the hill instead of down the hill) and navigate up the hill. When you are in position, lean your knees uphill and take small steps sideways. This can be useful when you have to get up a small incline or if you drop a pole uphill and have to retrieve it.</p>
                        <p>The other way to move uphill is the herringbone or duck walk. For this move, make a V-shape with the tails of your skis closer together than the tips. Flex your ankles forward and sink your knees inward, this will create a wedge so you don’t slide backwards. From there, you can walk around almost anywhere. Just make sure the tails of your skis don’t cross.</p>

    								<div class="col-xs-12">
    								<div class="single-tab">
    									<p>To turn your skis, start in a slight wedge position. To make a turn to the right, your left leg will actually do most of the work. Turn your left leg more and put more weight on your left work. It’s the opposite for a left turn. As always, keep your shins on pressed against the front of your boots.</p>
    									<p>To stop, do an exaggerated turn until you are completely perpendicular.</p>
                      <p>Getting on a chairlift is easy. Ski up to the line that usually says “Wait Here.” Once the chair in front of you passes, follow that chair to the line that says “Load Here.” Wait for the chair to come around, sit down, scoot all the way back, put the safety bar down and enjoy the ride!</p>
