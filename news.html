                          Austria</a></h5>
                    </div>
                    <div class="post-entry">
                      <p>The 2021 Freeride World Tour (FWT21) event in Fieberbrunn, Austria delivered some of the
                        biggest
                        lines possible during a very warm March in the Alps. The FWT declared last week that there would
                        only be one event in Austria, meaning Saturday’s competition was the last chance for many
                        athletes
                        to qualify for the Verbier Xtreme final as well as qualify for next year’s FWT.</p>
                      <p>The first skier of the day, Sweden’s Reine Barkered, opened things up by dropping straight to
                        the
                        famed Eagle Cliff, a committed series of drops that cut across the Wildseeloder competition
                        face.
                        After stomping his first big air, Barkered cut across the venue and popped a rollover into
                        refrozen avalanche debris. With his legs apparently made of steel, the Swede rode away cleanly
                        and
                        earned a score of 89.00, setting a very high standard early on.</p>
                      <p>After Barkered’s super-fast run, the majority of skiers dropped into the more playful, poppy
                        terrain on the looker’s left of the venue. American Ross Tester, who was the sixth man to ski
                        out
                        of the gate, executed a textbook backflip and spun a smooth 360 in this section, but what really
                        stood out was his confident and stylish turns between the two tricks. His slash on the wind lip
                        and perfect arcs in particular looked more like he was skiing for the cameras instead of just
                        trying to survive the venue.</p>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p>Ross Tester has now won two competitions during his rookie Freeride World Tour season and a
                          Polish rookie broke through in the women's field.</p>
                      </blockquote>
                      <p>Despite avoiding a final feature, Tester and his confident style impressed the judges. They
                        awarded the American a score of 90.00, which was enough to take the lead from Barkered and would
                        be the highest score of the day for the ski men. During an interview after the competition,
                        Tester
                        mentioned he was pretty influenced by fellow Völkl skis teammate Markus Eder, who skied a very
                        similar line last year at this venue, but crashed on the final feature that Tester skied around.

                              <p>Denver native Quincy Shannon knows that his upbringing—spending weekends in the
                                mountains nurturing a love for the ski lifestyle—was not the typical experience for a
                                Black man. He has his mother, who ran a ski program that introduced inner city youth to
                                skiing, to thank, and he is now working to pass down a similar love of the mountains and
                                the active lifestyle to his young daughter, Imani. Shannon shares why he skis, his
                                background, his inspirations, and how he hopes to parlay his passion for skiing into a
                                way to draw more BIPOC to the sport.</p>
                              <p><b>Because he was introduced to it early.</b> My mom was part of a Black ski club
                                called the Slippers-N-Sliders, so I’ve been skiing since I was 3 years old. Throughout
                                my childhood I was introduced to all the stuff that I love to do now—skiing, hiking,
                                climbing. I was lucky to be part of a small cohort of people in my neighborhood who
                                liked to get up into the mountains.</p>
                              <p><b>To fight misconceptions.</b> When I was a sophomore in high school, I was telling
                                some friends about my weekend skiing, and one of them said ‘you don’t come off like a
                                whitewashed black guy.’ I found out that most of them had never even been to the
                                mountains, much less skiing. They said, ‘That’s not a place for us.’ The more people I
                                talked to, the more I realized it was a truly unique experience among Black people.</p>
                              <p><b>Because he wants to enact change for his community.</b> Over the summer I began to
                                form several partnerships through Ski Noir at least in part because of the George Floyd
                                protests. The sustainability department at Aspen reached out about the job pipeline, to
                                get more Blacks employed in Aspen. I was very apprehensive at first, just wondering if
                                this was them really wanting to work with us because we are a missing demographic in the
                                mountains, or because the work pool had dried up because the borders were closed. They
                                were honest that it was a little bit of both, and I appreciated that they were really
                                open to create a partnership and move forward. I worked with them to figure out what the
                                job pipeline would look like, but also making sure that it wasn’t just placing Blacks in
                                entry-level jobs. I asked ‘What else are you doing around diversity, how are you working
                                to make more people of color feel comfortable in the mountains?’</p>
                              <blockquote>
                                <p>Quincy Shannon knows what’s stopping more Black people from skiing and he wants to
                                  use his voice to help grow the sport and make the mountains accessible for all.</p>
                              </blockquote>
                              <p>[The mainstream ski media can help] amplify the work that we’re doing and what we’re
                                trying to do. There are people who read what you guys are doing who I simply can’t
                                reach. If we all work together, we can introduce more people to the sport we all love
                                and help grow it for generations to come.</p>

                                          Cup Tour has come to an end, and for only the third time in the last nine

                                          of the season on March 20 and had a narrow shot at the title—she would need to
                                          win the race, and would need Petra Vlhova from Slovakia, the leader in the
                                          slalom standings, to finish third or lower.</p>
                                        <p>After the first run, it looked like the stars could align for Shiffrin. The
                                          American sat in third, 0.90 seconds off the pace set by Austria’s Katharina
                                          Liensberger. Vlhova, meanwhile, slotted into sixth after a conservative first
                                          run.</p>
                                        <p>But in the end, 0.90 seconds proved too big of a margin to overcome. Despite
                                          risking it all in the second run and nearly missing a gate just before the
                                          finish as a result, Shiffrin finished the 2021 season ranked second in the
                                          world to Liensberger in the slalom discipline. The Austrian claimed her first
                                          World Cup title after a blazing second run that saw her crossing the finish
                                          more than a second ahead of the competition.</p>

                                          <p>"It seems like just yesterday that I was doing an interview saying that we
                                            would be really lucky to ski this season at all, let alone be able to have a
                                            World Cup race season. And if we had one, I wasn’t sure if I was going to be
                                            ready to race in it. There was definitely a lot of uncertainty, and
                                            definitely a lot of self-doubt."</p>
